## Lab 2:
### The purpose of the first lab
-  create an about me webpage that contained a short bio about myself. 
- There was also to be javascript added to create an about me 5 question  guessing game to demonstrate basic understanding of:
- if/else statements
- prompts, alerts, variables, and console logs
- Functions, loops, and data strctures, were deliberately not used for this assignment.

## Lab 3:
- As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
 * Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
 * Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML

 - As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.
    * Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
    * Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
    * It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
    * After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
