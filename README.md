## Lab 2:
### The purpose of the first lab
-  create an about me webpage that contained a short bio about myself. 
- There was also to be javascript added to create an about me 5 question  guessing game to demonstrate basic understanding of:
- if/else statements
- prompts, alerts, variables, and console logs
- Functions, loops, and data strctures, were deliberately not used for this assignment.

## Lab 3:
- As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest so that the I can quickly view more information about them.
 * Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
 * Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML

 - As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses so that I can learn more about the site owner.
    * Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
    * Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
    * It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
    * After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

## Lab 3:
Features to add:

- Implement the following features using only what has been taught in class so far. No functions. No helper methods.
- Change work experience and education parts of the bio to an unordered list.
- ~Add a top ten list about myself using an ordered list.~
- For the guessing game, provide feedback on the responses.
- Add a 6th question that has a numeric answer. Give user feedback on high/low guesses. Allow 4 guesses. If guesses are used up, show the correct answer.
- Add a 7th question that has multiple answers. Store the correct answers in an array. Allow 6 guesses. Display all correct answers at the end. The game ends when user correctly guesses one of the possible answers.
- Keep score for the guessing game. Show user number of correct answers of the total questions asked (7).
- Use console logs to keep track of what questions have been asked.
- Add at least one more CSS style.
- Optional: put questions, answers, responses for first 5 questions into arrays (or array of arrays). Use for loop utilizing it.
- Optional: Make the 6th question a random number to guess.
