## Lab 2:
### The purpose of the first lab
-  create an about me webpage that contained a short bio about myself. 
- There was also to be javascript added to create an about me 5 question  guessing game to demonstrate basic understanding of:
- if/else statements
- prompts, alerts, variables, and console logs
- Functions, loops, and data strctures, were deliberately not used for this assignment.
