        <p style="background-color: purple;">My name is Kyrillos Khalil, but everyone just calls me "Kero". I'm currently 30-years-old. I was born in California, moved to texas in 2000, and just last year in August of 2020 I moved to Oklahoma to have a fresh start! I have a highschool diploma and some college background.  I was going to pursue a career in IT but my heart was not in it. Then I met someone who was a God send and gave me a great oppurtunity to attend Code Fellows and have an intership lined up with his company "Influence Mobile". My goal is to be a successful developer no matter what challenges I Might face!</p>
